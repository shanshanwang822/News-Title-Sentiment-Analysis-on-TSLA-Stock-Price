# News-Title-Sentiment-Analysis-on-TSLA-Stock-Price
Tesla, Inc. is a leading electric vehicle company that has been publicly traded on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol TSLA since 2010. It is one of the most prevalent and volatile companies in the market with a current YOY return of 129% and a five-year return of 1073% (Kabir, 2023). One of the reasons why TSLA value is so volatile is because it is heavily reliant on market perception and sentiment; positive and negative news, social media discussions, and public opinions are all impactful on stock prices. 

As such, this project aims to understand how news sentiment reflected in headlines and media coverage correlates with TSLA stock performance to understand the market dynamics and sentiment towards the stock performance.
